# Ios-Game-App
Log in and Play Dogeball!

I created a dodgeball game for IOS were you move a player with your finger to doge incoming balls. The score increases as time passes and you have 3 lives. 
You must log in to play. User data and scores are saved internally, and used for the top 10 best player scores page.

## What I Learned

- I learned to use storyboard to create an interactive app
- Gained experience in Swift and xcode
- Learned about making very simple movement-based games
